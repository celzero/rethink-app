/**
 * An animation that rotates the view on the Y axis between two specified angles. This animation
 * also adds a translation on the Z axis (depth) to improve the effect.
 */
class Rotate3dAnimation
/**
 * Creates a new 3D rotation on the Y axis. The rotation is defined by its start angle and its end
 * angle. Both angles are in degrees. The rotation is performed around a center point on the 2D
 * space, defined by a pair of X and Y coordinates, called centerX and centerY. When the animation
 * starts, a translation on the Z axis (depth) is performed. The length of the translation can be
 * specified, as well as whether the translation should be reversed in time.
 *
 * @param mFromDegrees the start angle of the 3D rotation
 * @param mToDegrees the end angle of the 3D rotation
 * @param mCenterX the X center of the 3D rotation
 * @param mCenterY the Y center of the 3D rotation
 * @param mReverse true if the translation should be reversed, false otherwise
